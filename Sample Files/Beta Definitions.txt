Beta Definitions

development (d): everything is in progress and the app might be completely unusable.
alpha (a): the app is feature-complete and has no known bugs — but, importantly, it’s had very little testing.
beta (b): the app is feature-complete, has no known bugs, and has been tested — but further testing is still warranted. Every beta is a release candidate.
